We measured brain activity using functional MRI while five subjects (“sub-001”, …, “sub-005”) listened to music stimuli of 10 different genres.

The entire folder consists of subject-wise subfolders (“sub-001”,…). Each subject’s folder contains the following subfolders:

1. anat: T1-weighted structural images

2. func: functional signals (multi-band echo-planar images)


Each subject performed 18 runs consisting of 12 training runs and 6 test runs. The training and test data were assigned with the following notations:

1.Training data: sub-00*_task-Training_run-**_bold.json

2. Test data: sub-00*_task-Test_run-**_bold.json


Each *_event.tsv file contains following information:

1. Onset: stimulus onset

2. Genre: genre type (out of 10 genres)

3. Track: index to identify the original track

4. Start: onset of excerpt from the original track (second)

5. End: offset of excerpt from the original track (second)


The duration of all stimuli is 15s.　For each clip, 2 s of fade-in and fade-out effects were applied, and the overall signal intensity was normalized in terms of the root mean square.

For the training runs, the 1st stimulus (0-15s) is the same as the last stimulus of the previous run (600-615s). For the test runs, the1st stimulus (0-15s) is the same as the last stimulus of the same run (600-615s). 

Preprocessed data are available in the derivative >> preprocessed_data folder. Experimental stimuli can be generated using GTZAN_Preprocess.py in the derivative >> stimuli_generate folder.

This dataset can be used for research purposes only. The data were anonymized, and users shall not perform analyses to re-identify individual subjects.
